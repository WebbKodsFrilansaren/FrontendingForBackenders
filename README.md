Simple GUI for adding HTML elements and stylizing their CSS code for faster and more convenient prototyping.

## Progress (Updates)

- 2023-07-11

  - Started since the first commit. Learning the real ins and outs of modular JS since I had no clue about "read-only".

  - You can add HTML elements to the shadowDOM under "HTML" and it adds some inputs.

  - You can copy both HTML and the CSS from the shadowDOM. But you also get all dataset attributes. Will be fixed.

  - You can also delete HTML elements from the shadowDOM, I am still working on being able to just remove parent element while keeping children element. It removes all children element now when removing a parent element while that is not reflected inside of the HTML TAB.
